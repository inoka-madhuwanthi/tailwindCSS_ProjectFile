Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable and utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built classes for rapidly building modern user interfaces. 
Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that focus on providing pre-designed components, Tailwind CSS takes a different approach by offering a comprehensive set of low-level utility classes. 
These utility classes can be directly applied to HTML elements to quickly style and position them, allowing for flexible and efficient UI development. 
With Tailwind CSS, developers have granular control over the design and layout of their projects, enabling them to create unique and responsive designs with ease.
